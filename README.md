# The-Data-Incubator---Project-Proposal

Amazon, the largest e-commerce marketplace, already became a part of our daily life. People can buy almost everything from Amazon, including the fine foods from other countries! However, facing tons of foods, how a client, especially a new user, could choose the best or right one? How the client, especially the new user could know what kind of fine food is the most popular?

In order to figure out the relationship between find foods and their reviews, which may help Amazon users to get their favorite products, I would do this analysis through the dataset: Amazon Fine Foods Reviews from Kaggle. It is a dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from amazon, spanning a period of more than 10 years, including all ~500,000 reviews up to October 2012. In this dataset, reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plain text review. It also includes reviews from all other Amazon categories. 

At this first stage, I will start to analyze 2 points: what does the product-reviewer graph looks like? How the users find the reviews are helpful?
